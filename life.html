<!--DescriptionCTF-->
<div id="collapse-content">    
        <p><strong>What is a CTF: </strong> 
            CTF stands for capture the flag, it's considered a computer exercise where players "capture" a flag, which is usually present as a line of text that looks something like FLAG{Y0u_g0T_m3}
            Usually after a CTF, players would produce writeup which are basically documents of the challenge(s) they have solved.
        </p>
        <p>Ive designed a small challenge within this website for people who are starting out, try to find the flag</p>
        <p>Flag format: MIRE{}</p> <!--- MIRE{h1dd3n_1n_th3_c0mm3nts} -->

            A very interesting CTF, aslo first time seeing one in malay. Cool!
            Got quite a few questions, some were really simple, some required <strong>EXTREME</strong> creative thinking
            learnt SO MUCH about php and all its funny quirks
            <br>No writeup, but i fully understand why people hate php
